## About This Project
* When you load the page, you have time slots from 8AM to 5PM
* You can fill out your day, then click save to add a task to the given hour. If you do not hit save, it will reset when you refresh the page.
* Past time slots will be grey, the current hour will be blue and future time blocks will be green to let you know what is coming, what is in the past and what is currently happening.
* The planner also shows the date and time at the top.
